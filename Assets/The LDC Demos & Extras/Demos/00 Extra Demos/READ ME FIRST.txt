EXTRA LDC DEMOS

Opening this package will unpack the extra LDC Demos. It is NOT advised to do this in your main project as there are some scripts used by Standard Assets that may have changed since the time the demos were made.

To use these demos, install the LDC plugin (and the extra demos) in its own empty Unity project.

... At the very least, backup your project first! =)
